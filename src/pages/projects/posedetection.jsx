          interaction. Using{" "}

          , I created an interactive interface where elements of the room change
          in real-time based on a user’s body positions through webcam video
          capture. In order to render web-based GUIs, I created a 3D model in
          Blender and imported it into Three.Js to render web-based GUI assets.
