          Inspired by the ambient track, View From My Window, by Hiroshi
          Yoshimura I created a web-based synthesizer and audio visualizer using
          vanilla <span className="font-bold">Javascript and P5.js</span>.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I programmed a particle system where each particle rapidly
          analyzes and reacts to the current audio’s frequency and amplitude
          playing using the Fast-Fourier Transform algorirthm, whether it be
          from the song, the user’s audio or the synthesizer. The synthesizer
          uses P5.js’s oscilattor, tuned to D Major so users can play along with
          the song.
